Preflight Checklist
 I have read the Contributing Guidelines for this project.
 I agree to follow the Code of Conduct that this project adheres to.
 I have searched the issue tracker for a bug report that matches the one I want to file, without success.
Electron Version
21.2.3, 20.3.5
What operating system are you using?
macOS
Operating System Version
macos 12.16.1
What arch are you using?
arm64 (including Apple Silicon)
Last Known Working Electron version
n/a
Expected Behavior
Fullscreen some app in macOS (for example I'v been testing with chrome).
Run the repro gist, which will wait 2.5 seconds and then make the following calls on the window:
mainWindow.setAlwaysOnTop(true, "modal-panel");
mainWindow.setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces(true, {
    visibleOnFullScreen: true,
});

Once you see the electron icon disappear from your doc (indicating the calls above have been made), switch to a macOS workspace that has a fullscreened window
Now I expect to see my electron window displayed above the other fullscreened macOS window
Actual Behavior
If you follow the above steps, the electron window is not displayed above the fullscreened window. If you manually select the electron window and move it around after calling setAlwaysOnTop and setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces, you get the correct behavior and the electron window will appear above your other fullscreen window
Testcase Gist URL
https://gist.github.com/9b3ea630126da8c77fb648a65fb8699d
Additional Information
I've tried various combinations of window.show(), window.focus(), window.moveTop() etc after setting the new window properties but it doesn't seem to make a difference.
